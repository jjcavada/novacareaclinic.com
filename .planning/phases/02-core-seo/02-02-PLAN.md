<objective>
Audit and fix heading hierarchy across all pages, and add contextual internal links.

Purpose: Ensure proper semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO, plus improve internal linking for better crawlability and user navigation.
Output: All pages have correct H1→H2→H3 hierarchy with no skipped levels, and relevant internal links within page content.

  <action>
Audit each page for heading hierarchy issues. SEO best practices:
- ONE h1 per page (typically in hero section)
- h2 for major sections
- h3 for subsections within h2
- h4 for details within h3
- NEVER skip levels (no h1 → h3, must be h1 → h2 → h3)

For each Interactive component:
1. Check if there's already an h1 in the page.tsx or hero section
2. If multiple h1 tags exist, change extras to h2
3. Ensure proper nesting (h2 sections contain h3 subsections)
4. Fix any level-skipping (e.g., h2 directly to h4)

Known issues to check:
- insurance-and-payment/page.tsx has inline h1, h2, h3 - verify nesting
- legal-compliance-hub has h3, h4, h5 - ensure h1 and h2 exist first
- Check each *Interactive.tsx for multiple h1 or skipped levels

Document findings as you go. Most Interactive components should have:
- h2 for section titles
- h3 for card/feature titles
- h4 for detail labels (if needed)
  </action>
  <verify>Use browser DevTools or view-source to confirm each page has exactly one h1 and proper heading nesting</verify>
  <done>All pages have correct heading hierarchy: one h1, logical h2→h3→h4 nesting, no skipped levels</done>

  <action>
Add contextual internal links to improve user flow and SEO. Use Next.js Link component for all internal links.

Specific additions:

1. **HomepageInteractive.tsx**:
   - In services preview section: "Learn more about our services" → /services
   - In team/provider preview: "Meet our providers" → /providers
   - In resources mention: "Browse patient resources" → /patient-resources

2. **AboutInteractive.tsx**:
   - Link to /services when mentioning treatment approaches
   - Link to /providers when mentioning team/staff
   - Link to /schedule-appointment in CTA sections

3. **ServicesInteractive.tsx**:
   - Link to /schedule-appointment after service descriptions
   - Link to /insurance-and-payment when mentioning costs/coverage
   - Link to /providers for "our team provides..." mentions

4. **ProvidersInteractive.tsx**:
   - Link to /schedule-appointment from provider cards or CTA
   - Link to /services for specialties mentioned

5. **PatientResourcesInteractive.tsx**:
   - Link to /schedule-appointment in crisis/help sections
   - Link to /contact for questions about resources

6. **ContactInteractive.tsx**:
   - Link to /schedule-appointment for appointment inquiries
   - Link to /insurance-and-payment for billing questions

Use descriptive anchor text that includes target keywords where natural. Example:
- Good: "Schedule an appointment with our providers"
- Bad: "Click here to schedule"

Import Link from 'next/link' if not already imported.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigate through pages and verify internal links work correctly and open in same tab</verify>
  <done>Key pages have contextual internal links to related pages with descriptive anchor text</done>
</task>
