# Phase 1: Resources Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Patients and families visit the Resources page and find mental health information organized by condition — not by source. Someone looking for help with depression finds a "Depression" section with handpicked resources from NIMH, SAMHSA, NAMI, and CDC all in one place.

The page feels curated and helpful, not like a dump of links. Each topic section has resources from authoritative sources, with Spanish versions available alongside English where official translations exist.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Trustworthiness** - Patients must see these are from official government/nonprofit sources they can trust. Clear source attribution.
- **Accessibility** - Easy to scan and find what they need. Clear labels, not overwhelming. Clean organization by condition.
- **Bilingual access** - Spanish-speaking families can find resources in their language without hunting. Spanish links presented naturally alongside English.

## Specific Ideas

- Organize by mental health topic/condition, not by source organization
- Core conditions to cover: Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Bipolar, PTSD
- Sources: NIMH, SAMHSA, NAMI, CDC (authoritative sources only)
- Bilingual: Include Spanish versions where official translations exist from these sources

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase delivers on the project's core value: "Real, authoritative behavioral health resources." The current Resources page has placeholder/mock PDF links that need replacement with real external links to trusted sources.

Quality over coverage — only include resources with official Spanish translations, don't create our own translations.
